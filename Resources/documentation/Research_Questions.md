# Research Questions
## Mortality Trends:

How did the overall mortality rates change during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the two years prior and the years following the peak of the pandemic?
What were the leading causes of death before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and how did their rankings change?
Public Health Protocols:

What were the specific public health protocols implemented by each country to control the outbreak (lockdowns, mask mandates, quarantine measures, vaccine distribution, government funding)?
How effective were these protocols in reducing mortality rates and controlling the spread of COVID-19?
Comorbidity Patterns:

How did comorbidity patterns evolve during the pandemic, and what impact did they have on COVID-19 mortality rates?
What correlations can be observed between COVID-19 mortality and other health conditions in different countries?
Predictive Analysis:

Using pre-pandemic data (2017-2019), can we accurately predict the leading causes of death and the number of deaths for 2020-2021? How do these predictions compare to the actual data?
Protocol Comparison:

How do the mortality rates and leading causes of death compare between countries with different public health protocols?
What are the key differences "in" mortality outcomes between countries with strict lockdown measures versus those with more relaxed approaches?

## Additional Areas of Exploration
Temporal Analysis:

Compare the timing of lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccine distribution with changes in mortality rates.
Analyze the lag effect between implementing public health measures and observable changes in mortality data.
Vaccination Impact:

Investigate the correlation between vaccine availability and distribution with reductions in COVID-19 mortality rates.
Compare vaccination rates and mortality outcomes across the selected countries.
Economic Impact:

Study the relationship between government funding (stimulus, subsidies) and public health outcomes.
Analyze the economic impact of public health measures and their effectiveness in controlling the outbreak.
Behavioral Analysis:

Examine public adherence to mask mandates and lockdown measures using survey data or mobility data.
Correlate behavioral compliance with mortality rates and COVID-19 case trends.
Geospatial Analysis:

Map mortality rates and public health measures geographically to identify regional patterns and hotspots.
Use geospatial tools to visualize the spread of COVID-19 and the impact of interventions.
Sentiment Analysis:

Analyze social media and news data to understand public sentiment towards public health measures.
Correlate sentiment trends with compliance rates and health outcomes.
